## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (at least Java 8)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-product-api.git
cd spring-boot-product-api
```

## H2 Database

The application uses an H2 in-memory database for data storage. You can access the H2 console at [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console) with the following credentials:

- JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
- User Name: `sa`
- Password: (leave it blank)

## Actuators

Spring Boot Actuators provide various production-ready features, including health monitoring. The health endpoint can be accessed at [http://localhost:8080/actuator/health](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health).

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/products`: Get a list of all products.
- `GET /api/products/{id}`: Get details of a specific product.
- `POST /api/products`: Create a new product.
- `PUT /api/products/{id}`: Update an existing product.
- `DELETE /api/products/{id}`: Delete a product.

Detailed API documentation is available in the [API Documentation](./API_DOCUMENTATION.md) file.

## Build and Run

Build the project using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Run the application:

```bash
java -jar target/spring-boot-product-api.jar
```

The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
